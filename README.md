## Final CodeClan Presentation Project 

### The brief 

I was given a charity brief with some specified areas of interest to explore and particular questions to think about answering. The brief specified open source data was to be used and so the raw and clean data are both publically available on my github. The analysis was hopefully going to shed some light on where more education and fundraising resources should be devoted to in Scotland. The infographics should be of good enough quality that they could be incorporated into the charity app if this were a project brief in the real world. 

### The data 

The data came from a variety of open sources including Public Health Scotland, NHS audits and National Records of Scotland. The data was all in xlsx format and I saved them as CSVs to export the data into RStudio. The cleaning script can be found on the github repo. Cleaning was relatively simple, mostly a case of pivoting the data into a long format, extracting relevant character strings from the columns and renaming variables.  

### The Analysis 

I chose to focus on four main areas for my analysis: incidences of brain tumours (both malignant brain tumour incidences and a combination of malignant and non-malignant brain tumours), survival rates (compared to leukaemia survival), mortality (deaths within 10 years of a diagnosis) and patient experiences after surgery. The analysis was typically producing easy to read and clearly documented graphs, calculating informative percentages and identifying any trends in the data.
