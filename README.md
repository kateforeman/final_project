## Final CodeClan Presentation Project 

### The brief 

I was given a charity brief with some specified areas of interest to explore and particular questions to think about answering. The brief specified open source data was to be used and so the raw and clean data are both publically available on my github. The analysis was hopefully going to shed some light on where more education and fundraising resources should be devoted to in Scotland. The infographics should be of good enough quality that they could be incorporated into the charity app if this were a project brief in the real world.
